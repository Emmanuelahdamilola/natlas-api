It implies ongoing discomfort without specifying its impact level.\n\n### Nigerian Health Context\nThis presentation suggests the following possible causes based on prevalence in Nigeria:\n1. Malaria – characterized mainly by headaches and joint/muscle pain.\n2. Typhoid Fever - Often presents with continuous headache and generalized body pain.\n3. Osteoarthritis – Musculoskeletal pain often seen among older individuals who engage in strenuous activities.\n4. Chronic Viral Hepatitis – Common in adults presenting both abdominal and musculoskeletal pain alongside occasional headaches.\n\nOther potential causes include dental problems leading to referred facial and head pain; respiratory issues causing headache-like sensations from sinus irritation; gastrointestinal disorders showing abdominal and back pain; and mental health-related pain usually manifesting as psychosomatic distress.\n\n### Recommended Medical",

If they say they feel extremely weak, then it's considered very severe; if only mildly weak, then it would be rated as less serious.\n\nNigerian Health Context: In Nigeria, people often use phrases like'mo ni mi' when referring to physical exhaustion caused by overwork or other factors such as poverty. This could potentially mask more serious underlying issues e.g., chronic illnesses requiring urgent attention from doctors before things get worse leading possibly towards organ failure etcetera. Therefore awareness about potential signs and seeking help early enough remains crucial regardless of whether one describes themselves merely having “low energy.”\n\nRecommended Medical Specialties: For evaluation regarding generalized feelings of tiredness/weakness, an individual might want to consult their primary care physician who can refer them accordingly depending upon further investigation results - internal medicine specialists, cardiologists, rheumatologists among others based off initial findings during examination process.",
